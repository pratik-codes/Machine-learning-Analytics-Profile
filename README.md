## [Zomato Prediction](https://github.com/pratiktiwari1212/Zomato_data_EDA)
- Cleaned, analysed messy data and created a predictive model with and accuracy of 93% with tree Regressor algorithm. The idea is analyzing the Buisness Problem of Zomato to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant and many more.

## [KPMG analytical task](https://github.com/pratiktiwari1212/KPMG_analytical_task)

- Dashboarding

## [Black Friday Prediction](https://github.com/pratiktiwari1212/Black_friday_prediction)
- Cleaned, and analysed messy data with about 8 lakhs rows and 12 variables and created a predictive model with 93% accuracy which predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

## [Bike sharing data EDA](https://github.com/pratiktiwari1212/Bike_sharing_data_EDA)
- Bike-sharing system are meant to rent the bicycle and return to the different place for the bike sharing purpose in Washington DC. We are provided with rental data spanning for 2 years. We are going to predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period.

## [Sales Analysis](https://github.com/pratiktiwari1212/Real_life_data_sales_analysis)
- This is a sales analysis project. The data consists of 12 montshs file Started from importing files and concatinating the files tried to come up with patterns and relations to get an insight on what factors affect the sales alot. This a very good method for companies to improve their sales gain insight on what products matters and how things are performing in different areas.

## [Customer Lifetime Value Prediction(R language)](https://github.com/pratiktiwari1212/CLVregressioninr)
- This project motive was to understand how CLV(customer value lifetime) can be calculated and can be very important as a company Also i did this in R langauage i applied Linear Regression to find the clv in future of a customer. This helps a company to determine which customers to target for thier offers as that customer is more important to the company

## Working on more projects. Coming Soon...
